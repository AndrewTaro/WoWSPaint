# WoWS Paint
The mod lets you draw anything freely in the game.  
Anything - a pixel girl, pixel ship, your strategy, point of interest, or whatever you want!

- If you are a player in the battle, the canvas automatically resets shortly after you disable the mouse (release the Ctrl key).
- For an observer in the training room, the canvas does not reset unless you click the "Clear Canvas" button.

These behaviors should be helpful for both situations.  
For example, when you are explaining something in combat, you probably don't want to press the clear button every time.  
On the other hand, you also don't like to flush the drawings by mistake while casting a tournament and breaking down a strategy/POI.

# Requirements
You must install the following for this mod to work:
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/gui/unbound2/mods/wows_paint.unbound`
4. Done!
